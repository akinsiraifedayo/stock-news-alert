# Stock Alert System
## One of my favourite 100daysofcode projects 
## Created by Ifedayo Akinsira-Olumide
This Python program monitors the stock prices of a specified company and sends SMS alerts using Twilio when the stock price increasesor reduces by a certain percentage. It also fetches news articles related to the company from NewsAPI.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required modules: `requests`, `twilio`

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python modules if not already installed:
pip install requests twilio

3. Obtain the necessary API keys and credentials:

- **Alpha Vantage API Key**: You can get a free API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/). Replace `YOUR_ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key.

- **NewsAPI API Key**: Sign up for a free account on [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and obtain an API key. Replace `YOUR_NEWSAPI_API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key.
